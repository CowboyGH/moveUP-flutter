## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- Added API documentation generation and local preview instructions to `README.md`.

### Changed

- Clarified documentation comments in bootstrap, DI, network, and auth-related files.
- Rebranded the project from template naming to `moveUP` for the initial baseline.
- Aligned Android and iOS identifiers to the new project identity (com.sibcode.moveup).
- Updated project/build configuration files to match the new app identity (platform configs, CI/CD, service files).
- Simplified CI to Android-only: removed iOS job and redundant steps, switched Docker build to a single APK (`app-release.apk`), and tightened formatting/test checks.

### Removed

- Removed legacy `flutter_starter_template` references and leftover template scaffolding from the codebase.
- Removed Firebase integration from the baseline (runtime initialization, Firebase dependencies, platform plugins/config references, and CI mock Firebase file generation).

### Fixed

- Fixed configuration mismatches introduced during template cleanup and project rebranding.

### Breaking

- Android Application ID / Namespace and iOS Bundle Identifier changed to `com.sibcode.moveup`.
- App root widget rename: `FlutterStarterTemplate` -> `MoveUpApp`.
